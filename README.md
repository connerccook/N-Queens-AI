Write a program to solve the N-Queens puzzle for any given value for N. The N-Queens puzzle is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; i.e, a placement where no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. This can be solved using a Genetic algorithm as described in class. Write a Python program that computes a solution to solve this puzzle and display the result graphically. Note that the Genetic Algorithm is already implemented in the textbook code (genetic_search() in search.py) and one state representation is also given (class NQueensProblem in search.py). Thus, the main tasks are:
Put these together, with any required modifications, to solve the puzzle.
Try different values for the different algorithm hyperparameters (such as mutation probability, size of population) to get the best results (i.e., solves it fast and finds a solution).
Create a simple GUI. You can use your own choice of graphics library. One choice is PyGame.
